15.png|Suppose L is regular.
16.png|Where p is the amount of states of DFA that
17.png|represents this language. n>=p means that w at least
18.png|visited a state twice. This means the route you take
19.png|between the first time you visit that state and the second,
20.png|can be deleted all together, or repeated
21.png|So, intuition failed.
22.png|We need a special rule that applies the regular languages.

26.png|If a GNFA has k>2 states (aka start and final state)
27.png|we can shrink the GNFA by taking out a state and repairing
28.png|the transitions with regular expressions so that GNFA still
29.png|recognizes the same language. We do this until k=2.
30.png|To satisfy start state end final state
31.png|conditions, we need to add new start
32.png|and final states and construct the NFA
33.png|without disrupting it.
34.png|Every arrow must exist from every state to other states and
35.png|to its own state. But transitions can be O so will we mostly
36.png|skip this.
37.png|There must be only one final state and it must have
38.png|transitions from every other state, but can't have
39.png|transitions to other states.
40.png|The start state should have transitions to every other
41.png|state but can't have transitions from other states
42.png|Transitions don't have to be just symbols. They can be
43.png|regular expressions.

47.png|If a language is regular, it can be described by both
48.png|a NFA and a regular expression. Then a NFA can be
